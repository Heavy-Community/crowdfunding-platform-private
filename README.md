# Crowdfunding Startups Platform

The platform provides the project owners the ability to initialize new funding campaigns for their startups. The owners are setting goal (desired funds to be reached) and timeline until the goal must be reached.

To deposit funds in a project, investors have to exchange ETH to the native tokens of the platform namely - "FundStartupBronze, FundStartupSilver, FundStartupGold". Each of the tokens serves as an equity token as well as utility token.

The equity token is as you expect, the more you invest, the greater equity(shares) you will posses when the startup launches. On the other hand, the utility token feature is something that every startup has to provide when they register their startup crowdfunding campaign in the platform. The incentive here is that the more catchy and profitable the perks you receive with the more silver/gold tokens you have, the more likely investors are to invest money in the startup thus making the greatest startup ideas benefit the most.

Let us take the example with a shop. If you invest "FundStartupBronze" tokens, treat them as if you have standard equity tokens. "FundStartupSilver" on the other hand, could mean that you receive free delivery on every fifth purchase. And "FundStartupGold" tokens will serve as a discount that you can give to other people thus receiving percentage of their purchases.

The investors are capable of investing certain custom tokens into particular startup project until its timeline to reach its goal hasn't expired. However if the startup's time to reach its goal has expired and it didn't succeeded to reach its goal, then all of the investors can withdraw their invested funds.

Speaking of withdrawal, if the startup has successfully achieved its fund goal, then **only** the owner of the startup (aka the initializer of the campaign for the startup project) is capable of withdrawing the invested funds.

If an investor changes its mind, they can revoke their staked funds, of course **only** if the time to raise funds for the particular project hasn't expired.
